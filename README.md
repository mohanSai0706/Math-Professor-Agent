🌟 Project Overview
The Math Routing Agent is a sophisticated educational AI system designed to revolutionize how students and educators approach mathematical problem-solving. By employing an Agentic-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, the system intelligently determines the best source of information—whether from a curated knowledge base or real-time web search—to provide comprehensive, step-by-step mathematical solutions.
Unlike traditional math solvers that rely on static databases or simple computational engines, our system combines the reliability of curated mathematical knowledge with the freshness of web-based information, ensuring users receive both accurate foundational solutions and cutting-edge mathematical insights.
